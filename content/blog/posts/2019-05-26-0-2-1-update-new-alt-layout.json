  "body": "**It has been requested a few times to add a full-page, featured image layout to the theme.** Version 0.2.1 adds this in and the setting for it is in the `Setup>Site Info` section in the `/admin` panel. I've setup an example blog, [Bael Alt](https://bael-template-alt-layout.netlify.com/), to showcase how it looks. It mostly uses photographs from my [Unsplash page](https://unsplash.com/@jake101) but there are a couple from my recent trip to Tokyo too.\n\n## What's New\n\n* Upgrade to Nuxt 2.7.1\n* Added Full Page \"Alt\" Layout (In the `/admin` panel, go to `Setup>Site Info` and set 'Full Page Alt Layout' to true to turn it on.)\n* Pagination fix\n* Fixed security vulnerability with webpack analyzer"
